FitPlus: Android app for healthy life.
Fit-Plus is an app that will help and encourage a healthy lifestyle. The basic theme of our app is
to facilitate fitness and provides various exercises which bring together a good workout session.

Many people need to modify their lifestyle and start adapting to a healthier one. This app will surely motivate them and help them in their journey towards fitness.
Our app has 12 workout exercises which is a 7-minute schedule that is your workout would be done in 7 minutes. It is effective and efficient.
Fit-Plus welcomes you to a dashboard page that has various components.**

**1)The workout section->** As mentioned earlier it provides workout exercises and is timed. It enhances your workout experience.

**2)History->** This maintains a record of the workout/exercise sessions you had. It stores the date and time of the day when you completed your whole schedule.
This data is stored using SQLite. It motivates the user to keep going, not missing any day and keeping up the motivation.

**3)Diet->** It consists of basic information regarding the meals of the day. It is the most basic aspect of our day-to-day life, yet we are not completely informed and educated about how to go about them. This section can be further worked on and can take shape of a diet planner. (due to time constraints, this was not possible)

**4)Excercise->** This is the section consisting of the list of all the exercises which are in the workout section and has an illustration of how these are to be performed.

**5)Age-Calculator->** This is a section where the users can come and calculate their age in minutes. This section is just to take a moment from your monotonous schedule and have a pleasant mood.

**6)Unscramble->** This is a game section consisting of jumbled words and the user has the task to unscramble it and write a meaningful word that can be made from the given set of words. There are ten jumbled words, which are related to health, body, and fitness. Each correct answer is awarded 20 points, hence the game is 200 points in total.

**As told by the organizers, we were asked to implement authentication of the Login and SignUp using SAWO LABS. We are making this project in android using Kotlin as the programming language and hence we faced a lot of difficulties while going about the authentication. Given below are the screenshots of the errors we faced and hence we could not work with SAWO LABS even after trying multiple times.**
